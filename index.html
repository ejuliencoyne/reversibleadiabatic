        <h2>ABOUT THE NAME:</h2>
        <p>A reversible adiabatic process is a type of thermodynamic process which results in no change in entropy (ie. it is reversible) and in which no heat is exchanged between the system and the environment (ie. it is adiabatic). Take two letters out of “process” and you get “press”.</p>
        <br />
        <h2>ABOUT US:</h2>
        <p>Reversible Adiabatic Press is a pet project born out of a wish for it to feel a little easier and more normal to self-publish a low-expectations book online. (See the foreword to our first project, Long Steady Distance.)</p>
        <p>We like books that are slow (like reversible processes) and that are idealized or imaginary (like adiabatic processes, which are a helpful approximation for problem-solving but do not actually exist in the real world).</p>
        <p>If you’ve written a book (loose definition; it could be pretty short) that you like and have no particular entrepreneurial aspirations for (ie. you’d be fine with having it online for free) but you nevertheless think “it would be nice to get this book all organized with a cover and everything so random people could read it”, shoot us an email (hello at reversibleadiabaticpress dot com) and maybe we can work together. We’d be especially excited about low-stakes speculative fiction but aren’t too picky. If literally anyone is interested in this we’ll put together some more specific guidelines surrounding submissions!</p>
